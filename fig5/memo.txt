In all the files, each column corresponds to following statistics:

1. the number of generating packets,
2. an average packet transmission completion rate,
3. an unbiased standard deviation,
4. the minimum value of the 95% confidence interval,
5. the maximum value of the 95% confidence interval.

ba, sw, and ke in the file stand for the BA, SW, and KE models, and memory and memory_p are the results by the memory and memory-pfix methods.
The numbers express the number of iterations for calculating the transmitting probabilities for the memory-pfix method.

For example, ba_memory_p_5_A.dat is the average packet transmission completion rate of the memory-pfix method for the BA model whose transmitting probabilities are determined by the first five iterations.
