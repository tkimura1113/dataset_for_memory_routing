In all the files, each column corresponds to following statistics:

1. the number of generating packets,
2. an average packet transmission completion rate,
3. an unbiased standard deviation,
4. the minimum value of the 95% confidence interval,
5. the maximum value of the 95% confidence interval.

ba, sw, and ke in the file stand for the BA, SW, and KE models,
and the numbers in the files express the number of iterations for caluculating the transmitting probabilities.

For example, ba_sp_A is the average packet transmission completion rate of the SP method for the BA model.
