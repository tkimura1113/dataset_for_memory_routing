In all the files, each column corresponds to following statistics:

1. the number of iterations,
2. the transmitting probability.

ba stands for the model and file names stand for the transmitting probabiities of 
h_h --- high-high degrees
h_l --- high-low degrees,
l_h --- low-high degrees,
l_l --- low-low degrees.

For example, ba_tp_h_h.dat is the transmitting probabily of edge between high degree nodes.
