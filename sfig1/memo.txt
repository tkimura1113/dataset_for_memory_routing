The transmission completion rates of the original and improved efficient routing methods are named "${topology}_${method}_${phi}_A.dat"

In all the files, the topology is composed of ba, sw, and ke, which stand for the BA, SW, and KE models. The method is composed of the original effective routing(oer) and improved effective routing method(er).

Each column in the files is expressed as:
1. the number of generating packets,
2. an average packet transmission completion rate,
3. an unbiased standard deviation,
4. the minimum value of the 95% confidence interval,
5. the maximum value of the 95% confidence interval.
