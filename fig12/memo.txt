The clustering coefficient(C) and the average distance between nodes(L) for each model is named "${topology}_${statistics}.dat"

In all the files, the topology is composed of sw and ke, which express the SW and KE models, and the statistics are composed of C and L.

The first column in the files is the rewiring probability for the SW model or the probability that adjusts the clustering coefficient for the KE model. The second column is C or L.
