In all the files, each column corresponds to the following statistics:

1. the number of iterations for calculating the transmitting probabilities,
2. the maximum value of R, where the transmission completion rate is lower than or equal to 0.9.

ba, sw, and ke in the file stand for the BA, SW, and KE models.

For example, ba_memory_p_con_A.dat is the maximum value of R, where the transmission completion rate is lower than or equal to 0.9 of the memory-pfix method for the BA model.
