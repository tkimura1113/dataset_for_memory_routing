In all the files, each column corresponds to following statistics:

1. the number of generating packets,
2. an average packet transmission completion rate,
3. an unbiased standard deviation,
4. the minimum value of the 95% confidence interval,
5. the maximum value of the 95% confidence interval.

ba, sw, and ke stand for the BA, SW, and KE models, respectively.
File names of deg and bet express that the packet transmission and storage performance are composed of the degree or node betweenness centralities, respectively.
For example, ba_deg_A is the average packet transmission completion rate of the SP method for the BA model whose packet transmission and storage performance are composed of the degree centrality.
